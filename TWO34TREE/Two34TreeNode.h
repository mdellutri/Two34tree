// Specification of ADT 2-3-4 Tree Node
//    data object: a node in a 2-3-4 Tree
//        contains room for 1-3 data items (just using keys)
//        contains room for 0-4 children
//    operations: several creates, destroy, 
//       cleanUpNode,
// Built on class Key 

// This class will be used by class Two34Tree.
//     All members are public to give Two34Tree access.
// Alternatively, we could make Two34Tree a friend class
//     of this class and all members would be private.
