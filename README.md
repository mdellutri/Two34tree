# Two34Tree

This project was one I worked on in 2018 with a peer , Kevin Shaw, under the instruction of Dr. Yerion during my Data Structures course at Gonzaga University.

It is a Two34 Tree that stores 7-digit phone numbers (a Key). 
It includes specifications of the abstract data type Key, tree nodes, and a client program. 

I, Mason Dellutri, in Two34Tree.cpp I personally constructed the methods destroyTree, isTwoNode, isThreeNode, isFourNode, inorder, noPointerInsert, twoKidsFullInsert, threeKidsFullInsert, and fourKidsFullInsert.
I also used partner programming with Kevin to construct the pretty method, which displays the data in the tree.
